# Journal Editorial Guidances

The quality of a journal is partly defined by the people that peer review for the journal. But it also partly
is the editorial standards set by the journal. These guidances give context to the peer review, and empower and guide
the reviewer in their work. In fact, it even guides the authors before the submit to this journal.

However, while there are generally some best practices, lost standards, and total no-go's, editorial guidances
are not FAIR. This overview will change that. It documents guidances, make them FAIR, give them scholarly context,
and provide help on how to use them in your writen, peer review, and editorial work.

Better, there will be guidance on how to use the FAIR guidances to create an editorial handbook for your
journal where you can select the items that matter to you and indicate if they are requirements (MUSTs),
suggestions (SHOULDs), or welcomed practices (MAYs).
